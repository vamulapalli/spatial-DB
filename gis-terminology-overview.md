##FILE EXTENSIONS:


#Shape Files:
 A shape file ia a digital vector storage format for storing gemetric location and associated information.
 
#GEOJSON:
 It is an open standard format for encoding collections pof simple geographical features along with their non-spatal attributes using javascript object notation.
 
 
# GPX:
The GPX is a Global Positioning System exchange format , a device-independent data format used for GPS navigation devices.

#KML:
Keyhole Markup Language ,It is an XML notation for expressing geograpic annotation and visualization within internet bored two dimensional maps and three dimensional earth browser.

#NMEA:
It is a combined electrical and data specification for communication between marine electronics such as echo sounder,sonars,GOS receivers and many other types.

#QEIS :
It is a graph or mape shader program.

WKT:
Well Known Text is a text markup language for representing vector geomentry objects and transformations between spatial refrence system.

#CSV:
A comma-separated values  also sometimes called character-separated values, because the separator character does not have to be a comma file stores tabular data  in plain-text form.

#OSM Files:
OSM files are nothing but the open streeat map files

#WKT:
Well-known text (WKT) is a text markup language for representing vector geometry objects on a map, spatial reference systems of spatial objects and transformations between spatial reference systems. 

##SOFTWARE:

#ArcGIS:
Esri's ArcGIS is a geographic information system  for working with maps and geographic information. It is used for: creating and using maps; compiling geographic data; analyzing mapped information; sharing and discovering geographic information; using maps and geographic information in a range of applications; and managing geographic information in a database.

#QGIS:
Quantum GIS is a cross-platform free and open source desktop geographic information systems application that provides data viewing, editing, and analysis capabilities.Similar to other software GIS systems QGIS allows users to create maps with many layers using different map projections. Maps can be assembled in different formats and for different uses. QGIS allows maps to be composed of raster or Vector layers. Typical for this kind of software the vector data is stored as either point, line, or polygon-feature. Different kinds of raster images are supported and the software can perform georeferencing of images.

#GPSBable:
GPSBabel is a cross-platform, free software to transfer routes, tracks, and waypoint data to and from consumer GPS units, and to convert between over a hundred types of GPS data formats.It has a command-line interface and a graphical interface for Windows, OS X, and Linux users.GPSBabel is part of many Linux distributions including Debian GNU/Linux and Fedora, and also part of the 'fink' system for getting Unix software on Mac OS X.

#Gdal:
Geospatial Data Abstraction Library is a library for reading and writing raster geospatial data formats, and is released under the permissive X/MIT style free software license by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a single abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats. It may also be built with a variety of useful command-line utilities for data translation and processing.


##DEFINITIONS:

#Point:
In modern mathematics, a point refers usually to an element of some set, called space, generally more or less related to geometry.More specifically, in Euclidean geometry, a point is a primitive notion upon which the geometry is built. Being a primitive notion means that a point cannot be defined in terms of previously defined objects. That is, a point is defined only by some properties, called axioms that it must satisfy. In particular, the geometric points do not have any length, area, volume, or any other dimensional attribute.

#Curve:
In mathematics, a curve  is, generally speaking, an object similar to a line but which is not required to be straight.It is also also called a curved line in older texts

#LineString:
A LineString is a one-dimensional object representing a sequence of points and the line segments connecting them.


#MultiCurve:
A Multi curve is a collection of zero or more geometry or geography curve instances.



#MultiLineString:
A MultiLineString is a collection of zero or more geometry or geography LineString instances.


#SurfacePolygon:
A surface is one polygon which represents the outer bounds of an array, plus optionally a list of polygons which represent exclusions from that outer polygon.

#MultiPolygon:
A MultiPolygon has no two Polygon elements that cross or crossing is also forbidden by the previous assertion, or that touch at an infinite number of points.

##RELATIONSHIPS:
Relationship is the relation between the two pr more geomentry or geography points/line/curve instances.

#Touches:
Touches means the two line or curve meet at some point but doesnot cross over each other.

#Crosses:
Crosses is nothing but the inter section of two or more geometry or geographic curve or line instances.

#Within:
A point or line liying inside  a give geometric area is then that point or line is said to be with in that area.


#overlap:
A point or line with is liying over some other point  or line or curve is said to be overlapping.
